# 🏆 Winner of the 2024 Spring Portfolio Design Contest (ACM @ CSUF) 🏆

## 🚀 Project Overview
I built this project in under 3 days solo, showcasing my game development skills and serving as a simple portfolio of all my projects and contact info.

## 🛠️ Built With
The project was entirely crafted using Unity and was exported using Unity's built-in WebGL exporter, with some tweaks to HTML and CSS.

## 📚 What I Learned
Embarking on this journey, I had never built a website using Unity. Despite facing exporting bugs and issues, I managed to create something that I'm quite proud of under tight time constraints.

## 💖 Favorite Part
My favorite aspect of the project is navigating the website on the monitor itself. The combination of audio and visuals brings back the nostalgia of an old Windows XP machine.
